## Initial Study

The initial study included a survey (Coffee-Survey.txt) to researchers at Brock University to determine how many drink coffee, how many per day, and at what times of day they were consumed.  The data collected from this survey (Coffee-Survey-Results.csv) was processed by an R programming script (Survey-Results-Cleanup.R) which produces a bar chart of the results for quick reference (see below).
